This project tested multiple face detection algorithms such as Face recognition python module, the CNN, the SVC, and MediaPipe prototypes with the usage of opencv or real time webcam capture.

With the intention of creating an employee attendance system with less complication face registration, during the test it is found that face recognition is less complicated and suitable in terms of time efficiency and effectiveness.

In conducting the test I believe that the CNN and other algorithms alike requires more face training dataset in order to get better accuracy. Though we believe among face detection algorithms CNNs are known to be the most accurate rather better than the face recognition module.

To simplify, the face recognition module does not require to run epochs or training, but rather just one sample picture of a person to detect them on camera.
